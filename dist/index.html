  <p>PART 1: PREPARATION</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="divisor">Select an Interface</div>
  <p></p>
  <p>For this exercise I have chosen to select the personal waffle making station at one of the dining halls on my college campus. This station includes a batter section, a waffle maker, and the condiment station next to it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="divisor">Prepared Questions</div>
  <p></p>
  <p>Have you used this station before?</p>
  <p>     (If no) Were you able to figure out how to use it before starting?</p>
  <p>     (If yes) how many times?</p>
  <p>Is there anything about the station that wasn’t clear when you first used it?</p>
  <p>Did you encounter anything unexpected while making your waffle?</p>
  <p>Are you on a time budget? As in, do you have a class within a half hour to an hour from now?</p>
  <p> Would you be having a waffle for breakfast if you weren’t able to make one yourself, and had to get it from a line?</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="divisor">Sketch and Description</div>
  <p></p>
  <p>Below is a simplified version of the station, for ease of clarity</p>
</div>


      <div class="infoBox" id="1">
        <img src="img/waffle.png">
        <div class="textItems">
          <p>A) Plastic cups, manufactured with fill lines for the appropriate amount of batter</p>
            <p>B) A tap that pours out waffle batter</p>
          <p>C) The waffle iron, which needs to be lowered and rotated after batter is put in</p>
          <p>D) Instructions for use</p>
          <p>E) A timer for indicating when the waffle is done</p>
          <p>F) Assorted condiments</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="regularText">
      <p>This interface is attempting to solve the problem of cold, unappetizing waffles not being eaten at breakfast by allowing students to make them fresh for themselves, minimizing wasted food and maximizing enjoyment from students.
      </p>
<p></p>
      <p>PART 2: RECORDING OBSERVATIONS</p>
      <p></p>
        <div class="divisor">Observations</div>
      <p>The main observational note I have is that new users were not prepared to flip the waffle iron over after closing it. On pouring in the batter and closing the iron, many hesitated for 3-15 seconds before flipping (looking confused). Users with more experience did not have this issue. Other than that distinction,  both types of users went through the same processes. Both types of users were also very likely to pull out their phones during the 2 min 30 seconds it took to cook the waffle.
      </p>
        <div class="divisor">Interview Points</div>
        <p>- Users had a variety of levels of experience</p>
        <p>- Most users had classes soon after the time they were using the machine</p>
        <p>- Users who were unfamiliar with the iron were startled when the continuous beeping happened after pouring in batter and closing. While some were able to figure out that they needed to flip it from reading the instructions after it was lowered, others most likely wouldn’t have figured it out for long enough for one side to be burnt had another person not stepped in to help.
        </p>
        <p>- New users did not notice the instructions written on the waffle iron before use, as they were behind the uplifted iron top (see earlier diagram)
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>PART 3: PERSONAS</p>
        <p></p>
        <div class="divisor">Sort of Shy Susie</div>
      </div>

      <div class="infoBox" id="2">

        <img src="img/susie.png">
        <div><p>Sort of Shy Susie is a first year on campus with a lot on her plate, is pretty unfamiliar with a lot of things, and is a little shy about asking for help and talking to others.
        </p>
          <p>As a student with a lot of things to do and places to be, she generally doesn’t have time to slow down. That, combined with her wanting to not look lost and confused, leads her to not inspect the waffle iron close enough to find the instructions behind the flipped up iron. When she does make a mistake, she is too flustered to realize that the weird spinning thing the timer is doing now is actually trying to indicate she needs to rotate the iron.
          </p>
            <p>This persona represents a lot of the users who are somewhat unfamiliar with the environment, very unfamiliar with the machine, and overall trying their best to not look like they’re confused
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="regularText">
        <div class="divisor">Waffle Whiz William</div>
      </div>
      <div class="infoBox" id="3">
        <img src="img/william.png">
        <div><p>William is a third year on campus with an equally large amount of work on his plate, and has been coming to this cafeteria for waffles very frequently over the past two years.
        </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>While William had once been new to the wafflemaking interface, he has now grown accustomed to it and no longer struggles with making waffles. At this point, his only problems are the remnants of what other users had left on the station: assorted drips of batter or burnt waffle bits stuck in the iron.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>William represents the user base that has been using the interface for a while. He has become accustomed to the process, so he no longer gets caught off guard by oddities of it. Users like William are the ones who breeze through interactions with the interface, and are so used to it that the actual process they go through doesn’t occupy their thoughts.
